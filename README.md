### Part Two: 
  The maps represtned above are of the type choropleth which are mostly used to indicate the quantities of certain things in certain locations. Based on the first map, which      represents the number of 311 complaints across NYC in the month of June, 2021, it can be determined that many complaints were concentrated in the Bronx and Queens areas. They are also focused on the north western side of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. However, they are most in the Bronx and Queens. Illegal Fireworks complaints are also focused around the same locations as the 311 complaints, but with less intensity around some areas, according to the seocnd map. Midtown Manhattan and a little bit of the lower Manhattan side had the least concentration of illegal fireworks complaints. Based on the third map, illegal fireworks made up most of the 311 complaints in the Bronx and Queens areas. Based on the data provided, we can conclude that 311 complaints and fireworks complaints were moslty concentrated in the Bronx and Queens, but they were also present in other Bouroughs, but at a lower concentratino level.
